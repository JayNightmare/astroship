        Hello, and welcome to my profile!

        I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Kingston University, 
        building on my foundation in Applied Science from college. During my childhood, 
        I played for the Maltese basketball team, my time being a part of the team, I learned how to be 
        a great team player, possessing a 'can do' attitude. I'm committed to putting in the hard work necessary 
        to achieve my goals. If you're interested in connecting, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via LinkedIn 
        anytime. 
        
        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!
